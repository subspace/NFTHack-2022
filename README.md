# ðŸ”’ Meta Vault

Meta Vault is a decentralized storage vault to archive your most precious on-chain assets. This allows a user to connect their Metamask & Polkadot.js wallet to the dApp and it pulls your Assets from your wallet. It will then show them and provide an opportunity to archive them using the Subspace Network for cheap a cost effective archival solution.

# ðŸ“– Documentation

To run this app you will need to have installed some minimal dependencies.

- node.js: `>= 16`
- truffle: `npm i -g truffle`
- yarn: `npm i -g yarn`

This projects run on `rinkeby testnet`, you need an `account with funds` to deploy contracts, create Collections and mint NFT's, and use the dApp.

- Get rinkeby Ether in the faucet. https://faucet.rinkeby.io/

## Folder structure

### subspace

Subspace.js library to connect and use the Storage API.

### truffle

Contains the solidity contracts to be used in the dApp.

- truffle .env

**MNEMONIC**, Account used to deploy and test the dApp.
**RINKEBY_URL**, URL for the wallet provider. (Infura, Alchemy, etc.)

```
MNEMONIC="flash ........... beef"
RINKEBY_URL="https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/API_KEY"
```

### dApp

React dApp, uses metamask and polkadot extension to deploy and mint NFT's on Ethereum and also put and get metadata and files using the Subspace Network Storage.

- dApp .env

**REACT_APP_NODE_WS_PROVIDER**, Subspace Network node.
**REACT_APP_FARMER_WS_PROVIDER**, Subspace Network farmer.

```
REACT_APP_NODE_WS_PROVIDER=wss://aries-test-rpc-b.subspace.network
REACT_APP_FARMER_WS_PROVIDER=wss://aries-test-rpc-b.subspace.network/farmer
```

## Run

### Truffle

Go to truffle folder and run. (Need .env created with an account with funds and a provider endpoint)

- `npm ci && truffle compile`.

If you want to test and deploy contracts run:

- `truffle migrate --network rinkeby`.

### Subspace.js
